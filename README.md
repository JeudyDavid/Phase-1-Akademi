Overview
This project analyzes aviation accident data to identify low-risk aircraft for 
a company entering the aviation industry. By understanding patterns in accidents and 
incidents, we aim to guide decisions on which types of aircraft the company 
should acquire, ensuring reduced risk and enhanced safety.



Business Problem
a company is expanding in to new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are 
interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do 
not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft. You are charged with determining which
aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. You must then
translate your findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can
use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.


Data Understanding
this project utilize an extensive dataset from the National Transportation Safety Board covering aviation 
accidents from 1962 to 2023. This includes detailed information on incident causes, aircraft types, ect.
